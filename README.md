# ECG-Solution

This project was developed as part of a specialized academic concentration in artificial intelligence. In this concentration we learned computer vision and deep learning techniques. It was made for a research biology professor from the University of Pennsylvania. The main goal was to detect myotubes based on segmentation and training a CNN model. 

I contributed to the image processing and segmentation of the myotubes's images, given from the professor. I applied thresholding, erosion and dilation. I also collaborated in annotations using rectangles and polygons mainly and generated JSON annotations (created by LabelMe) which are essential for supervised learning tasks in CNNs.
